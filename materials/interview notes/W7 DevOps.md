### Review Topics
- Terminology


## Terminology
### Jenkins
- **Jenkins** - automation tool for devops pipelines
- **Controller** - the central system for managing all nodes; handles administration of the Jenkins server
- **Node** - generic term for anything that runs jobs
- **Agent** - an isolated node with access to only its own directory
- **Freestyle Job** - a standard job that triggers a series of build steps
- **Pipeline Job** - configures more advanced, sequential operations that can occur between build agents; conceptually similar to chained freestyle jobs
### DevOps
- **DevOps** - the combination of the development process, along with its integration in cloud services and deployment
- **Pipeline** - the tools, practices, and environment which enables developers to automate everything from tests, builds, branching, pushing, to production deployment
- **CI/CD** - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment; the general process of automating parts of the DevOps pipeline
- **CI** - Continuous Integration; a partially automated operations process, which could include tests and builds, but doesn't automate the entire process
- **CD** - implementing automation throughout the entire pipeline
- **Continuous Delivery** - a hybrid between **CI** and **CD**
