## User Stories
User stories are high-level descriptions of what the end-user wants from a narrative point of view. Anyone involved with the project should be able to understand the language, and is often used to drive development of tests and features

User stories generally follow this syntax: *actor*, *action*, *intent*.
	**As a** user, **I want to** save my pictures **so that I** can view them later
