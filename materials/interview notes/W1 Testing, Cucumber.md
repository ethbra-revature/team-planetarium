## Principles of Testing
- **Testing reveals defects, not their absence**
- **Exhaustive testing is impossible**
- **Test early**
- **Defects tend to cluster**
	- 80% of defects occur in 20% of the code
- **Pesticide Paradox** / Tests wear out
- **Testing is contextual**
- **Absence of Error Fallacy**



## Terminology
- **Test Object** - the item which is being testing
- **Equivalence Partitioning** - using one test case/value to represent a class of defects
- **Velocity** - in the context of Agile, *velocity* is the number of story points completed in a sprint

## System vs. End-to-End Testing
System testing looks for defects by testing the overall functionality and performance of the fully integrated application. End-to-end is more limited in scope, looking only at how components interact with each other and measuring the flow of the software
